### Important

**Elasticsearch upgrade notice.** We'll be raising Elasticsearch compatibility to 7.* in the next release. Up until now, Segments API supported Elasticsearch 6.*.

We recommend two upgrade scenarios:

- When new release is ready, you can upgrade your existing cluster based on the documentation available at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html.
- If you clear your Elastic data recurrently and archive stored events to CSV, you can spin up new v7 cluster and configure [Telegraf](./Docker/telegraf/telegraf.conf) to push data to both v6 and v7 of Elastic. Once you're satisfied with the amount of data in v7 (~1 month tends to be sufficient), wait for the next release and change Elastic address in Segments API to v7 cluster. If there are no issues, you can stop pushing new events to v6 cluster in Telegraf and stop the cluster completely. 

### Docker

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `spotify/kafka` docker image with `wurstmeister/kafka` as original image was no longer maintained and new installations stopped working. remp/remp#638
  
  - In case you have existing installation in place using the docker compose, please run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose stop beam_tracker telegraf
    docker-compose rm beam_tracker telegraf
    docker-compose build beam_tracker telegraf
    ```  

### [Mailer]

- Added API endpoint `mailers/mail-templates` to list and filter available mail templates.
- Added early-version support for search in the top searchbox. Searchable are emails (templates), layouts, jobs and newsletter lists. GH-69
- Added early-version support for WYSIWYG editor in Template edit form. It's configurable in `config.local.neon`, Mailer keeps HTML editor as default for now. GH-58

### [Sso]

---

## [0.10.0] - 2020-04-07

- Datatables in all projects now store filters/ordering in URL hash, not in local storage. Previous solution was buggy and didn't allow users to share their filters with other users. GH-56
- Javascript building now supports linking of shared `remp` package within the projects. You can now link the package with `yarn link --cwd ../Package/remp && yarn link remp` inside the app folder. Command `yarn watch` is able to watch for changes in the shared package. GH-63

### [Beam]

- `rempConfig.tracker` configuration option `explicit_referer_medium` is deprecated and renamed to `refererMedium`. The old one is still accepted due to compatibility reasons.

### [Campaign]

- Updated layout footer with link to REMP website. remp/remp#522

- Added support for campaign segment exclusion. User now need to match both inclusion and exclusion segment rules to see the campaign banner. GH-33
- Overal rectangle banner button text and main text attributes are now optional. This is useful when e.g. only using picture inside the banner. remp/remp#582
- Texts in collapsible bar, bar and medium rectangle bar templates are now optional. remp/remp#597

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Attachment parameter in `send-email` API is now required to be base64-encoded to support PDF (and other binary) attachments.
- **BREAKING**: Context checking during email sending now only checks if user received an email with given context before; Mailer ignores `mail_template_code` being sent. In previous version, two different mail templates with same context could be sent to the same user. This version prevents such behavior. remp/crm#987
- **BREAKING**: Removed hardcoded support for Errbit/Airbrake error logging, added support for Sentry logging. See README for details on how to configure Sentry to track errors.
- Updated layout footer with link to REMP website. remp/remp#522
- Added possibility to filter hermes payload parameters in logs. Parameters `password` and `token` are already filtered by default. See `config.neon` for reference how to extend filtering with own parameters.
- Added hermes handler to unsubscribe users from mail type if emails are dropped. You can enable the feature in `config.local.neon` (see example file for reference). remp/remp#566
- Added configuration for allowed preflight (`OPTIONS`) headers into configuration. You can configure them via `%preflight.headers` parameter - see [example use](Mailer/app/config/config.neon).
- Fixed possible duplicate email for same context being sent, in case the emails were scheduled at the same time via `send-email` API.
- Fixed and redesigned mailing list variants statistics to be sortable and filterable. remp/remp#593
- Fixed attachment_size column type - changing to integer (from incorrectly assigned datetime).
- Added option to select events to handle when starting Hermes worker in case there's need to run separate workers for mission-critical event types.
- Fixed possibly incorrectly skipped newsletter subscription in user registered API handler. remp/crm#1159

### [Sso]

- Updated layout footer with link to REMP website. remp/remp#522

### [Beam]

- (GO) Removed unused vendor files.

### [Campaign]

> **Elasticsearch upgrade notice**. We'll be raising Elasticsearch compatibility to 7.* in the beginning of 2020 to keep with the latest changes. Current implementation Segments API is tested and maintained again Elasticsearch 6.*. Please plan your upgrade accordingly.


### [Beam]

- Added experimental database-based dashboard data source which works with snapshot of "concurrents" data made every minute. Snapshotting is being done automatically for you against *concurrents_by_browser* elastic index. This should be populated by your Telegraf instance based on [similar configuration](https://github.com/remp2020/remp/blob/master/Docker/telegraf/telegraf.conf#L73).

- [Segments]: Fixing mapping fetching changes which was causing "include_type_name" deprecation notices since Elastic 6.8. This is to prepare to provide full compatibility for Elastic 7.* and drop compatibility promise for 6.* in the following months.


## [0.8.0] - 2019-07-08

_Note: Generated binaries were not changed since 0.7.0, there's no need to redeploy them if you have 0.7.0 deployed._

### [Beam]

- New functions for tracking commerce events were added to give caller more precise control over what is being tracked.  See documentation of following methods in https://github.com/remp2020/remp/tree/master/Beam#js-tracking-interface:

  - `remplib.tracker.trackCheckoutWithSource`
  - `remplib.tracker.trackPaymentWithSource`
  - `remplib.tracker.trackPurchaseWithSource`
  - `remplib.tracker.trackRefundWithSource`

- In some cases, Beam's database could have been migrated with invalid default value for conversion's _paid_at_ column. https://github.com/remp2020/remp/commit/553c2dcf9120b0b54e938d7e3f5f1a9dca3a73e2

### [Campaign]

- New configuration options were added to append extra query parameters to banner's target URL in case target page needs to identify source page/article and referer is not enough.

  See `rempConfig.campaign.bannerUrlParams` object at https://github.com/remp2020/remp/tree/master/Campaign#javascript-snippet for more detailed info:

  ```
  bannerUrlParams:  {
      "foo": function() { return "bar" },
      "baz": function() { return "XXX" }
  }
  ```

- HTML banner now supports custom JS and CSS inclusion from external sources.
- Bugfixing HTML banner's Farbtastic color picker which was not being initialized after the latest dependency changes.
- Material checkbox was not being rendered properly in Mailer causing custom generator implementations not being able to use it.
